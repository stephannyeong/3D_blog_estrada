Having spent the last ten days with Rob, an environmental scientist from Holland who spent several months living in Palawan to help start a sustainable lobster farm, Katrien and I were dead set on finding him some crustacean deliciousness, stat. Katrien told the Lobster Lady to scour the town for me or a tall Dutchman named Rob and she dutifully did just that, finally running into us at the fruit stand down the street from The Alternative. The Lobster Lady was a sight to behold: she was at least a head shorter than me and likely half my body weight, with shoulder-length gray hair and only 2 teeth. She brought us to her banca boat and we departed with a net full of 8 squirming, angry lobsters.\r\n\r\nThe lobster came in at just over 2 kilos, and we asked the staff at The Alternative if we could pay them a pseudo “corkage fee” to steam them. We also ordered a platter of garlic fried rice, bought a 1.5L jug of Carlo Rossi red wine and bought some Cloud 9 chocolate bars for dessert.\r\n\r\nIt was one hell of a meal, and coming in at $7.50 each including wine, dessert and side dishes, it was well worth it. While Rob, John and David have moved on to their next destinations, the remaining 3 of us are looking out for the Lobster Lady around town, excited to repeat our lobster feast.\r\n\r\nReference from: https://www.legalnomads.com/lobster-feast-in-el-nido-palawan/\r\n(For educational purposes)', NULL, '2022-12-18 03:59:12'),

Rice noodles in a tomato and crab broth, tofu, fresh herbs, a spicy hint but you can add so much more. I have not found bun rieu I enjoyed in either of Montreal or New York, but I spent my birthday at Authentic Pho Vietnamese Restaurant (250 Greenbank Road, just north of Hunt Club), owned by a Vietnamese family who made a delicious Saigon-style bun rieu.\r\n\r\nAlso worth trying if you’re not celiac: their grilled beef satay summer rolls (goi cuon bo satay).\r\n\r\nBanh Cuon and Bun cha\r\nWhen I was a lawyer in New York, I used to eat at a place called Annam, which was at the corner of University Place and 12th Street. My apartment was right around the corner and I would head here frequently to order what I only referred to as “the number 7.” On their menu as an appetizer, I never knew what these pillowy steamed rice crepes were until I went to Vietnam for the first time in 2012. It was there that I learned they were called banh cuon, literally “rolled cakes” made of rice flour and folded around a filling of wood ear mushrooms and ground pork.\r\n\r\nI found these delicious rolls at only one restaurant in Ottawa, and that was Pho Bac (873 Somerset St. W, Tel: (613) 563-0788) a teeny Vietnamese spot on Somerset that reminded me of the restaurants in Saigon. It felt like someone’s living room happened to also be used as a dining room. The owner is from the North, and earnestly explained that I should definitely go to Hanoi if I wanted real banh cuon. I didn’t want to tell him that I had been for that very reason as he already seemed confused about my questions involving mung bean chicken soup.\r\n\r\nIn addition, their bun cha was delicious, not only because the meat was grilled nicely but also because the spring rolls were made from rice paper (banh trang), as opposed to many of the other places I’ve seen in Ottawa. The other spots often used thicker paper, a mixture of rice and wheat flour, which wasn’t safe for me and other celiacs. Thankfully Pho Bac cooked with the real deal, and like that header photo taken in Saigon, resulted in crispy cha gio (fried spring rolls).\r\n\r\nCheck their Facebook page for hours and an updated menu.

(14, 6, 4, 'The Trumpification of Elon Musk', 'Once again, a single narcissistic troll has short-circuited our ability to have a sensible discussion about the future.\r\n\r\nAROUND THE TIME - Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, I said to colleagues in the newsroom where I worked at the time that we shouldn’t cover everything he said or tweeted. Previously, a president’s every word was assumed to be a carefully chosen signal of future policy, and was reported as such. Trump, on the other hand, clearly said many things purely to get a rise out of people. Reporting on them, I argued, just fed the flames. Another editor pushed back. “He’s the president,” he said, or words to that effect. “What he says is news.”\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, we saw a slew of rapid-response news stories about Musk’s tweet on December 11 that “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,” a dig at the government’s former chief infectious disease expert, as well as at gender diversity. Here’s another bunch about the picture of his bedside table with two replica guns on it, and some more about his tweeting a far-right Pepe the Frog meme.\r\n\r\nNews coverage of what Musk is doing at Twitter betrays another trope of the Trump years. There’s a large category of stories that report with a kind of ghoulish delight on moves that will surely—surely!—sink the platform in short order, like alienating advertisers and influential users. Meanwhile, there’s a drumbeat of pieces from right-wing outlets that just as willfully ignore Musk’s worst behaviors to argue that his slash-and-burn tactics are literally the only way to rid Twitter of excess bureaucracy and make it profitable, as if it were such a pit of vipers as has never been seen in the annals of corporate management. \r\n\r\nThis is precisely the way coverage of Trump worked. The liberal-leaning media were often drawn to stories confirming the belief that a person so clearly unfit to be president would only succeed in bringing himself (or the country) down in flames, while the right-wing media treated his evident egomania, corruption, and lack of interest in grasping basic policy issues or actually doing the job as at best irrelevant and at worst essential qualities for reforming Washington. There was plenty of good reporting going on at the same time, but these polarizing accounts tended to dominate the conversation. The losers were the public, whose understanding of what was actually happening across the country was forced through incompatible narratives around the behavior of one unhinged man in the White House.\r\n\r\nThis is what’s happening with Musk and Twitter. Conor Friedersdorf in the Atlantic describes a “dysfunctional relationship between Twitter’s new owner and so many of the journalists who cover him … where the least defensible statements and claims on all sides are relentlessly amplified in a never-ending cycle that predictably fuels disdain and negative polarization.” \r\n\r\nFriedersdorf goes on to argue that Musk’s journalistic critics should give him more benefit of the doubt; after all, he did ban Kanye West, he refused to reinstate Alex Jones, he’s right that Twitter helped suppress the story about Hunter Biden’s laptop that later turned out to be at least partly true, and maybe his idea of amnesty for suspended accounts is not such a bad way to reset the clock and rebuild overall trust in the platform. But I think that strays toward both-sides-ism and misses the point.\r\n\r\nThe point isn’t that Musk may not be as terrible as you think. He is definitely terrible. Just as Trump was unequivocally unfit to be president, Musk is unequivocally cruel, vindictive, a heartless manager, and a troll who amplifies extremists. (Over the weekend he sicced his followers onto Yoel Roth, Twitter\'s former head of trust and safety, who fled his home with his family after getting threats.) He is also a chaotic leader who, far from having a plan, is—in the words of Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist and self-confessed admirer of Musk—“winging this.” It’s entirely possible that he will either destroy Twitter outright or turn it into what right-wing platforms like Gab and Parler only dreamed of becoming.\r\n\r\nThe point is that the focus on Musk is a mistake. Arguably not as much of a mistake as it was with Trump; an owner-CEO has more power over their company than a president does over their country. But trying to report on what’s happening by expecting either his abject failure or resounding success and then using his most attention-grabbing tactics as evidence for that thesis is not doing anyone a service. \r\n\r\nAs with Trump, the real story is often what’s going on below the level of newsmaker in chief. It’s about the actual numbers around Twitter’s advertising, not Musk’s claims that advertisers are coming back. It’s about who’s actually joining and leaving Twitter, not about who’s threatening to leave. It’s about Twitter’s role in the world—its importance to natural-disaster management or to any number of communities for whom it’s a store of social wealth—rather than just how much money it will lose. Musk and Trump subvert the ability to focus on such nuances by making the story all about themselves. The very same tactic that draws their fans ensnares their critics. And we, by which I mean everybody, but especially the media, fall for it every time.\r\n\r\nJust before Musk bought Twitter, I tweeted a prediction that “not much [will] change. Trump et al will come back, trolling will increase somewhat, rest of us will block and mute more and engage less but still use it for publishing—more web 1.0, less 2.0.” As foolish as it is to make predictions, and as crazy as the past six weeks have been, I still think this is as plausible a long-term outcome as any other. It’s neither the destruction of Twitter nor a turnaround, but a bet that the platform is too important to too many people to disappear altogether and will hobble along, however dysfunctionally, in some form. This prediction could be utterly wrong, but its chief quality is that it’s boring. People should make boring predictions more often. Like boring opinions, they are more common and more likely to be accurate, but they get short shrift because they don’t fit the easy narratives of success or failure.\r\n\r\nBoth the Trump and Musk sagas show that we are still in the thrall of the great-man theory of history. The desire so many have to see people like these either soar or burn produces an attendant bias in evaluating them—a feeling that their actions are the only ones that really matter. That’s what produces this breathless obsession with their every move and blinds us to more complex information that might paint a clearer picture of the messier reality—and whatever future we’re barreling toward.\r\n\r\nReference from: https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-elon-musk-media/\r\n(For educational purposes)\r\n', NULL, '2022-12-18 04:04:26'),
(15, 6, 4, 'Twitter is a mess, so former employees are creating Spill as an alternative', 'Alphonzo “Phonz” Terrell and DeVaris Brown met during orientation on their first day working at Twitter. They didn’t know that just a few years later they’d be building a social media platform of their own.\r\n\r\n“We were the only two Black guys in there, and we were like, ‘Hey, we’ll be friends!\'” said Terrell, who served as the platform’s global head of Social & Editorial until last month, when he was one of thousands of employees laid off upon Elon Musk’s takeover. Brown was a product manager lead at Twitter working on machine learning, but left Twitter in 2020 to found Meroxa, a Series A startup that makes it easier for companies to build their data pipelines.\r\n\r\nToday, Terrell and Brown are announcing waitlist signups for Spill, which they describe as “a real-time conversational platform that puts culture first.” They expect that the platform will launch in about six to eight weeks.\r\n\r\nAs Black creatives and technologists working in social media, Terrell and Brown have watched as Black women, queer people and other diverse communities have powered new trends on platforms like Twitter and TikTok, only to be overlooked. In the same way that Black founders are unfairly dismissed in venture capital, Black content creators have had their work stolen and earn fewer brand deals than white creators, studies have shown.\r\n\r\n“I think this is really a platform issue,” Terrell told TechCrunch.”Even before I left Twitter, over the last several months, I was just talking to Black female creators, talking to Black queer creators and I’m like, ‘How do you make your money? Is any platform supporting you? Does the idea of Spill interest you?\'”\r\n\r\nSo, it was important to the founders that Spill builds in creator monetization features from the get-go. Spill will use blockchain technology to chart how posts go viral and compensate the creators behind them, but Terrell deliberately refuses to call Spill a web3 company.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a web3 thing,” Terrell told TechCrunch. “But the use of blockchain is for both crediting creators and setting up a model for us to compensate them automatically. If they have a spill that goes viral and we monetize it, it’s really effective.” Spill hasn’t decided yet what the revenue share will look like, or what method will be used to track how posts drive ad revenue, but Terrell says that creators will “absolutely get real cash” in U.S. dollars, not cryptocurrency. The blockchain technology is something that lives under the hood in the tech stack, not something that users will be bombarded with.\r\n\r\nLike Twitter, Spill will have a live news feed where users can post “spills” (a step up from Mastodon‘s “toots“). They’re called “spill” after the phrase “spill the tea,” and Terrell said that they’re leaning into the teacup motif. Even their website sports a Kermit sipping tea meme (which, by the way, was popularized on Black Twitter). Spill is also building a feature called “tea parties,” where users can host both online and IRL events, then get in-app bonuses to apply to things like boosting their posts. Users can still buy boosted posts, but Terrell says that, “if you’ve been creating and crushing it on Spill, we’re going to give you these things.”\r\n\r\nBrown, who is serving as Spill’s CTO, is extending the company’s commitment to honoring cultural production into the very fabric of the platform.\r\n\r\n“This will probably be the first, from the ground up, large language content moderation model using AI that’s actually built by people from the culture,” Brown told TechCrunch.\r\n\r\nThere is an established history of racial biases within the hate speech detection algorithms that most social platforms use — one study showed that tweets written by African Americans were 1.5 times more likely to be flagged as offensive or hateful, while tweets written with AAVE (African American vernacular English) were 2.2 times as likely. AI can’t understand the cultural context in which certain speech is being used, especially if the developers behind the AI are people who don’t understand — and have made no attempt to understand — the linguistic nuances of cultures beyond their own. But if anyone can change that, maybe it’s Brown.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to be more intentional and be more accurate around things that will be deemed offensive, because, again, this is our lived experience or learned experience,” he said. “It’ll be much more accurate to catch those kinds of things that will detract from the platform that would not lend to creating a safe space for our users and our creators.”\r\n\r\nSpill is building with a small team — less than 10 people, plus three advisors, including Dantley Davis, Twitter’s former design chief. Other buzzy Twitter competitors like Hive have run into security issues when building these kinds of products without a robust team. But Spill’s founders are confident that they won’t fall into the same trap.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got John McClane and MacGyver here!” said Brown. “Phonz, on the content and social side, has run some of the largest and most successful campaigns in the world.” At Twitter, Terrell’s team won a Webby Award for Best Overall Social Presence, and before that, he led social media marketing at HBO. “And then you have me, who literally has run some of the largest web scale services, probably since the advent and popularization of cloud computing. This isn’t our first rodeo.”\r\n\r\nSpill’s waitlist is live now, where users can reserve their handle and receive updates before the platform’s launch.\r\n\r\nReference from: https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/16/spill-twitter-alternative/\r\n(For educational purposes)', NULL, '2022-12-18 04:06:08'),
(16, 6, 1, 'Shopping With My Preteen', 'I was 11. It was almost summer, my mom and I were at the local mall, looking for a bathing suit. I’d not yet banished her from the dressing room and was desperate for the suit that “everyone” (“EVERYONE, MOM!!!!!”) had: one of those bikinis that attached on the sides. Remember those, from the early ’90s?\r\n\r\nI was, at the time (who am I kidding, I still am), someone who liked to please my mother and basically everyone else in my life, so when I pulled The Suit off the hanger — I still recall it perfectly: a yellow, blue and white striped top with navy bottoms that hooked together just above my hip bones — I was so, so eager for Mom’s approval.\r\n\r\nShe gave it a sort of “what the hell is that” look. I was crushed. What was I to do now?\r\n\r\nI tried it on. I loved it more. She did not. I sincerely did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps this is the moment to say that I, firmly in middle age, am still a person who texts friends photos of me sporting random outfits from the dressing room with “y/n.” Although I know my style and mostly trust my instincts, I like seeking guidance from others. And back then, my mother was my only guide and we’d never, well, disagreed about clothing before.\r\n\r\nWe stood in the dressing room, both of us staring at my prepubescent body in the mirror in what I’m now sure my mother thought was a mildly inappropriate swimsuit and I thought was my whole new reason for being.\r\n\r\nSurely she was thinking: Can I let my preteen wear this thing in public?\r\n\r\nI was thinking: If only I could convince her to like it! Then I could get it! But no. That wasn’t happening. Nothing was going to make her come around to how perfect it looked on me.\r\n\r\nThe wait felt interminable.\r\n\r\n“I will buy it for you,” she finally said, when it became clear that it was the only suit I’d wear, “but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. You have to like it, even if I don’t.”\r\n\r\nNow, writing these words down now, three decades later, I see that it sounds like a very Jewish Mom thing to say. Like, “you know I hate it and if you get it, you’ll wear it knowing HOW MUCH I HATE IT!!”\r\n\r\nBut at the time, I think my mother was trying to teach me that it was actually okay to wear something she didn’t like; that maybe it was simply enough that I liked it. That I’d have to learn to work through the not insignificant discomfort this caused me, and that maybe the discomfort wasn’t bad. Maybe it was a necessary part of growing up.\r\n\r\nAnd this, for a kid like me, who was so firmly enmeshed with my mom that I’m surprised I had a single opinion of my own, was enormously liberating. I could have my own desires?\r\n\r\nIt is surely what allowed me to pierce my nose at 19, even though I knew my father was furious at me for doing it. It’s what helped me to wear all sorts of bizarre outfits through high school and college (and beyond) with confidence, and to shave my head and then grow out my hair and style it in every possible way. And it’s what let me begin to distinguish my taste from my mother’s (and everyone else’s).\r\n\r\nSo, here I am now, the mother, staring into a new mirror.\r\n\r\nMy preteen and I went shopping over the weekend and I was banned from almost every dressing room she went in. We bought nothing — the outing was more about the fun of trying things on, not of actually coming home with anything — but her impulse was to choose pieces and don them in private. I found some part of this enormously thrilling. Unlike young me, she isn’t seeking my approval! Or maybe — dear God, I hope not — she is and wanting it so much she won’t even let me in, for fear of what I’ll say.\r\n\r\nI am right at the beginning of this journey of wading into preteen/teen clothing choices, of her doing things without my knowledge or permission, and I can already tell that it’s going to be a doozy. How do we weigh what we like versus what is “appropriate” versus our idea of what “appropriate” is versus current styles versus old feminist views versus new feminist views versus the reality of the misogynistic violent world we live in? I have no idea. Like, none. I’ve had many talks with mothers of teens to help me navigate this tricky territory. I have more questions and complicated feelings than I can count.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that I want my daughter to trust her instincts – even if they differ from mine. I want my kid to explore. I want her eye and desire to wander wild. I want her to feel free and powerful and at home in her beautiful body. I want that to last as long as it possibly can.\r\n\r\nAbigail Rasminsky is a writer, editor and teacher based in Los Angeles.

(17, 6, 1, 'Is Vaping Safe and What Are the Risks?', 'They say sitting is the new smoking, but there’s a new trend that’s just as concerning: vaping. This smoking alternative is catching on fast. And some say it’s a healthier option. But is vaping safe or healthy?\r\n\r\nWhile the answer is pretty simple (no), this article will cover some of the risks and side effects. Plus we’ll explore whether vaping really is a healthier alternative to tobacco cigarettes.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Vaping?\r\nVaping is inhaling the aerosol created from e-cigarettes. The inventor of the first successful e-cig is often cited as a Chinese pharmacist and heavy smoker, Hon Lik. But, electronic delivery systems have been around since at least 1963. E-cigs came to the U.S. in 2006 as a smoking cessation aid. \r\n\r\nSeveral things make up an e-cig vaping device. You’ll find a mouthpiece, a battery, a cartridge with liquid, a heating element/atomizer, and a microprocessor. Sometimes the vape pens and devices have an LED light. The e-cig heats up the e-liquid and creates an aerosol to inhale. Some vaping liquid has nicotine and some don’t.\r\n\r\nThe liquid generally has a mix of propylene glycol to boost flavor and vegetable glycerin for more vapor. Vaping products like the Juul brand are popular with high school students because they offer so many flavors.\r\n\r\nIs Vaping Safe?: Risks and Side Effects\r\nWhen vaping first became well known in the U.S., it seemed like a good tool to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes. But vaping grew in popularity among non-smokers too. Teens and young adults especially.\r\n\r\nThe wide array of flavors, combined with thinking vaping was completely safe and without side effects spurred its popularity. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. It turns out vaping isn’t only a gateway to smoking, cravings, and other addictions. It’s also full of toxins.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the risks and side effects of vaping.\r\n\r\nImpaired Wound Healing\r\nWe know cigarette smoking causes impaired wound healing. But vaping liquid with nicotine isn’t any better. Like cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users are told to quit vaping a few weeks before and after surgery. This helps avoid infections and complications in healing.\r\n\r\nSmoker’s (Vapor’s) Cough\r\nVaping can cause a cough like a smoker’s cough. The e-liquid vapor can irritate the throat and lungs, leading to a cough.  \r\n\r\nVaping Toxins\r\nThough it may seem better than cigarettes, vaping liquid also has some nasty toxins. A study in Pediatrics found that teens who vaped had 3x as many toxins in their bodies as those who didn’t smoke or vape. Teens who both smoked and vaped had 3x more toxins than those who just vaped.  \r\n\r\nOther research shows e-cig vapor reduces our cell’s glutathione. Glutathione is an important antioxidant that protects cells from damage. Thanks to less glutathione, 85% of human mouth cells in the study were destroyed. Cell damage can lead to long-term health effects, like cancer.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular Disease\r\nSmoking is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. And it increases blood pressure and heart rate. Vaping may also cause an increased risk of heart disease. A 2018 report found vaping doubles the risk of a heart attack. Vaping and smoking at the same time increase the risk by 5 times. \r\n\r\nHousehold Hazards\r\nVaping can pose a household hazard, especially when children and pets are involved. E-liquids often have a yummy tasting, flavored nicotine. According to the APA, cases of kids accidentally ingesting vape liquid went up 1,500% in just 3 years. While that number went down some in 2015, it jumped up yet again in 2017.\r\n\r\nVaping Liquid Ingredients\r\nThe ingredients in e-cig liquid are concerning, too. \r\n\r\nFormaldehyde: A 2015 study found that e-cigs heated with high-voltage batteries release formaldehyde.\r\nDiacetyl (an ingredient in e-liquid) is linked with a rare lung disease that permanently harms lung airways.\r\nPropylene glycol is another concerning ingredient. The authors of a 2015 review voiced their concerns with propylene glycol in vaping liquid. It was only given the “Generally Recognized As Safe” designation by the FDA based on one animal study done in 1947. Propylene Glycol may be safe to eat in small amounts, but we don’t know how safe or unsafe it is when inhaled. \r\nNicotine: Many vaping liquids also have nicotine. Nicotine has its own risks. It affects all body systems, including the heart, breathing, kidneys, and reproductive systems. This chemical also raises cancer risk and suppresses the immune system. Nicotine users are also more likely to get eye diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration.\r\nIs Vaping Safer Than Smoking?\r\nIt seems reasonable that vaping is at least less harmful than smoking. Research suggests this could be the case.\r\n\r\nA 2017 found smokers who switched to vaping for 16 months had fewer carcinogens and other toxins in their bodies. Another study from the same year found the cancer risk from vaping is about 1% of the risk of smoking.\r\n\r\nCan Vaping Help You Quit Smoking?\r\nThe UK’s Public Health England has even put out a statement supporting vaping instead of smoking. Many people start vaping in an effort to quit smoking, but that doesn’t always work out. A study with over 1,800 smokers found a link between vaping and unsuccessful smoking cessation. In other words, people tried to quit by using the e-cig but failed. \r\n\r\nSmokers who call into state tobacco quitlines aren’t faring much better. Researchers found that smokers who try to use vaping to quit smoking were much less likely to be tobacco-free than those who never tried vaping.\r\n\r\nA 2020 Cochrane review of over 50 studies found:\r\n\r\nE-cigarettes probably help people quit smoking for about 6 months.\r\nNicotine e-cigarettes seem to work better than nicotine replacement therapy (like the nicotine patch).\r\nNicotine e-cigarettes may work better than behavioral support or no support.\r\nWe need more reliable evidence to know for sure what the effects are.\r\nBottom Line: Vaping is less harmful than smoking but not harmless, by any means. Vaping may help some people quit smoking, but not everyone. Ultimately, there’s no healthy alternative to smoking besides not smoking.\r\n\r\nVaping and Young People\r\nMany health officials and parents worry vaping is a gateway to tobacco use for teens. And lots of research is coming out on the subject. At first glance, these studies seem concerning.\r\n\r\nThe NIH found that high schoolers who vaped were more than twice as likely to pick up smoking. However, these studies don’t account for how many teens would start smoking anyway. Regardless of whether or not they had access to vaping.\r\n\r\nWhile vaping is growing in popularity, teen smoking is not. A large 2017 on UK teens and vaping found teen smoking rates continue to go down despite vaping use. This suggests vaping doesn’t lead to more smoking. \r\n\r\nThe latest 2022 update found e-cigs only slightly increase the chance of picking up cigarette smoking. Unlike earlier reports, this one accounted for other factors, like if kids were around other smokers and behavioral risks. By adding these variables they found that the risk was a lot lower than previously thought.\r\n\r\nBottom Line: It’s unlikely that vaping is a huge risk factor for smoking, but it’s still not healthy. Efforts should focus on teaching teens about the health risks of both.\r\n\r\nEssential Oil Vaping\r\nEssential oil vaping is like e-cig vaping but uses a mix of vegetable glycerin and essential oils. It’s like an individual essential oil diffuser. Brands like MONQ recommend breathing the vapor into the mouth (but not the lung) and exhaling through the nose. \r\n\r\nBut there are no long-term studies to show essential oil vaping is safe. MONQ’s disclaimer lists the side effects of vaping essential oils, including: \r\n\r\nDry mouth\r\nSore throat\r\nEye irritation\r\nBurning sensation\r\nCoughing\r\nHeadache\r\nWheezing\r\nNausea\r\nLoose stool\r\nBottom Line: Without any studies or long-term use showing essential oil vaping is safe, I don’t recommend it. Also, any benefits you can get from essential oil vaping can be gained through regular oil diffusing instead. \r\n\r\nIs Vaping Safe and Healthy: Final Thoughts\r\nInhaling anything but clean air is a potential risk, and that includes vaping. While it may be helpful for those who already smoke, it’s not the best option. Quitting smoking and vaping altogether is still the best choice.\r\n\r\nThis article was medically reviewed by Dr. Michelle Sands, ND.

(18, 6, 3, 'TOP 10 FUN THINGS TO DO IN MANILA, PHILIPPINES FOR FIRST-TIME VISITORS', 'Metro Manila is a bustling yet vibrant metropolis — and though a lot of locals and tourists alike will quickly advise you to escape the capital and explore the more popular and natural beauty of the Philippines, I assure you that there are still a key number of things to do in Manila that will make your stay or layover worthwhile.\r\n\r\nJust look past the traffic and towering skyscrapers, and you’re sure to find a treasure trove of culture and fun activities. Such things are surely not limited to tourist spots, foodie and shopping destinations, lively nightlife, and even historic attractions that anyone will surely love!\r\n\r\nSo without further ado, here are some of the best places and experiences that you might want to try when you want to explore more of Metro Manila.\r\n\r\n1. Visit the grand complexes of the National Museum\r\n2. Do an Old Manila tour in Intramuros\r\n3. Try Lakbay Museo\r\n4. Check out Instagrammable ‘museums’\r\n5. Work up some adrenaline at Asylum Manila\r\n6. Bring family and friends to Manila Ocean Park\r\n7. Do a Malabon tricycle tour\r\n8. Experience the city’s vibrant nightlife\r\n9. Indulge in a gastronomic food tour\r\n10. Go on a day trip to nearby districts — or explore famous malls\r\n\r\n» BEST TIME TO VISIT\r\nAverage temperatures in Manila do not vary as much — as such, it is generally hot and humid (with a chance of rain about half of the year). Most of the time, March is when it is the hottest, and June to August is when it starts to get rainy with chances of typhoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n» PHILIPPINE CURRENCY\r\nPhilippine peso (PHP / ₱) wherein USD $1~ or €0.85~ is equal to about Php48~ (this is as of April 2021). In the event that you want to exchange your money for PHP, I highly advise that you do NOT exchange your money at the airport since the rates there are not competitive.\r\n\r\nHow to best exchange your currency? Either exchange it at a bank or at a money exchanger in your home country or in any city center in the Philippines. Better yet, just withdraw from an ATM with your debit/credit card — however, you must do one big withdrawal to minimize fees with your bank. Speaking of cards, a lot of Philippines establishments accept credit cards but it’s always advisable to have cash on hand because a lot of smaller shops do not accept cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n» COST OF TRAVEL IN THE PHILIPPINES\r\nMuch like any other country in Southeast Asia, the cost of travel in the Philippines is relatively low compared to other parts of the globe such as Europe.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea, you should expect to travel to the Philippines with an average daily cost of about USD $20~ (Php 1,000~) per person on a budget, or at least $50~ (Php 2,500~) if you want to experience more comfort on activities, tours, hotels, and more. (Values below show low budget to medium budget ranges only).\r\n\r\n\r\nReference from: https://iamaileen.com/things-to-do-in-manila-philippines/\r\n(For educational purposes)', NULL, '2022-12-18 04:11:51');
